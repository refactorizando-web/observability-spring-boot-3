# Observability example with Spring Boot 3

## Introduction

One of the changes in Spring Boot 3 has been observability. In this new version of Spring Boot micrometer
is in charge on observability so to add observability in your application you need to add micrometer dependency.


        <dependency>
          <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
          <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
          <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
          <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin</artifactId>
        </dependency>


After add these dependencies we are going able to enable observability in our services
and export traces to grafana.

## How does it work?

This is a Simple Spring Boot 3 application, son to run it you can run with maven:

       mvn spring-boot:run

or you can run it with your IDE.

## Problem and Resolution

One of the problem that can be appeared using micrometer with restTemplate or WebClient is that
the traceid propagation fails. So if is this your case you have to be sure that you are creating
the restTemplate or the WebClient with the "builder".
